# Backend Portfolio Project

## Introduction
This is the backend repository for my portfolio website. It is designed to handle data management and security for the portfolio's frontend. The backend is built with Spring Boot, utilizing Java, MySQL, Spring Security, and Lombok for a robust and secure application.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- JDK 1.8 or later
- MySQL 5.6 or later
- Maven 3.2+

### Installation
To set up the backend server on your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://your-backend-repository-url.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd your-backend-project-directory
```

3. Configure MySQL:
   - Create a new MySQL database named `portfolio`.
   - Update the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file with your MySQL username and password.

4. Run the application using Maven:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The server will start running on `http://localhost:8080`.
